- 👋 Hi, I’m Tahsin
- 🎓 I'm currently a PhD student in the civil engineering department at the University of Arizona, Tucson, USA
- 👩‍🔬 My research focus is structural health monitoring (SHM), wireless sensor network (WSN)
- 📌 Most of my work involves structural dyanmics, system identification, output based modal analysis, system-level and individual node level quality improvement of WSN
- 📌 I have been working in battery health management of WSN in a simualated reinforcement learning (RL) environment with PPO-based algorithm
- 📌 I have also some experiences in strain-based sensor board developement and arduino programming
